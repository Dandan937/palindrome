-  you could also go through every char (element) in every array in the 2d array and search for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal palindromes

-  I can get rid of the ending letter as instead of making a string that only goes to the ending letter and submitting that, i can just submit the word as it scans along the line
;  to do the above ^, i would need to have something like a checkPuzzle() method, and then have the searchH, searchV, searchDUR, and searchDDR methods inside of it

-  so i can have a boolean variable to begin with, and have a for loop that adds 1 to the index of whatever board space it's on, and then if its out of bounds then make it go back in bounds, and if it's not itself then you add that char into word and check if it's a palindrome
